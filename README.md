# There are two steps to follow before using the plugin, which are listed below

## Step 01 - Rembg Installation
- Go to "CPP-UE-GetThumbnails\Source\Python" and run "InstallRembg.py".
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system to be able to use the above script.
- Rembg is necessary to remove the background of the extracted thumbnail images. If not installed, the extracted thumbnail images will have the default Unreal Engine checkered background.

## Step 02 - Plugin Installation
- Download the latest release from the GitHub repository.
- Unzip the contents of the zip file.
- Remove the "-main" text from the unzipped plugin folder name at the end if it's there, and if not, then leave it as is.
- Go to your Unreal Engine project directory and look for the "Plugins" folder. If there is none, then make one.
- Copy and paste the unzipped plugin folder into the Plugins folder of your Unreal Engine project.
- Build and open the project.
- Once the project is open, enable the plugin (Plugin Name is "GetThumbnails" inside Unreal Engine) from the Plugins menu if not already enabled.
- Below is a tutorial video for you, but I suggest you stick with the README file, as it's the most up-to-date and contains all the necessary steps in depth.
